I attached diagrams with some modifications.

AccountManagementCase
- missing use case: Upload personal information (A PC Member uploads personal information when joining a conference; this can be included in
  Create account use case)

ConferenceManagementCase
- delete Add Room - there are multiple rooms attached to a conference, in the '... sections' use case, not here
- delete Make the selection of sessions optional or mandatory - it's always optional
- delete co-chair (because it's the same role as chair) and the authorized user

OrganizingPresentationsCase
- session and sections are the same thing, so Add conference section and Create session are doing the same thing; please keep only 
  Add conference section

proposal and bidding management
- Submit proposal is done by author
- missing use case: Upload full paper

ReviewManagementCase
- Review Submission is done by PC Members
- missing use case: Request closer evaluation (chair asks the reviewers to talk about a paper in order to get closer evaluations)



Green use cases = primary use cases, please describe them just by adding preconditions / postconditions; also, use just these cases in
sequence diagrams
X = delete
Missing use cases: please add them in the right place and add preconditions / postconditions to them.

You can do this by the next lab and it's all right.
